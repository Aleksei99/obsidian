#### JMM (Java Memory Model)
- **Overview**: Describes how threads in the Java programming language interact through memory and what behaviors are allowed in concurrent execution.
- **Memory Types**:
  - **Heap Memory**:
    - Stores objects and class instances.
    - Shared among all threads.
  - **Stack Memory**:
    - Stores local variables, method call details, and partial results.
    - Each thread has its own stack.
  - **Metaspace** (from Java 8):
    - Stores class metadata.
    - Replaces PermGen space.
  - **PC Registers**:
    - Each thread has its own program counter (PC) register.
    - Points to the next instruction to be executed.
  - **Native Method Stacks**:
    - Used for native method invocations.
