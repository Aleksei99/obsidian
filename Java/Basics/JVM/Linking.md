Performs verification, preparation, and (optionally) resolution.

- **Verification**: Ensures the correctness of the `.class` file, i.e., it checks whether this file is properly formatted and generated by a valid compiler or not. If verification fails, we get a runtime exception `java.lang.VerifyError`. This activity is performed by the component `ByteCodeVerifier`. Once this activity is completed, the class file is ready for compilation.
  
- **Preparation**: The JVM allocates memory for class static variables and initializes the memory to default values.
  
- **Resolution**: This is the process of replacing symbolic references from the type with direct references. It is done by searching the method area to locate the referenced entity.
